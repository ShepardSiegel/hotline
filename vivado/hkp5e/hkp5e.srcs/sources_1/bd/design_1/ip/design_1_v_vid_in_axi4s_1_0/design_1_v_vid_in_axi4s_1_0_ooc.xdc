# This constraints file contains default clock frequencies to be used during out-of-context flows such as
# OOC Synthesis and Hierarchical Designs. For best results the frequencies should be modified# to match the target frequencies. 
# This constraints file is not used in normal top-down synthesis (the default flow of Vivado)
# Create clock commands for top level.
