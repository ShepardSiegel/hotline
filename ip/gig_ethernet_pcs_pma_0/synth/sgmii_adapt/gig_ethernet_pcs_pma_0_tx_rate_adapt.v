// Description: This module accepts transmitter data from the GMII style
//              interface from the attached client MAC.  At 1 Gbps, this
//              GMII transmitter data will be valid on evey clock cycle
//              of the 125MHz reference clock; at 100Mbps, this data
//              will be repeated for a ten clock period duration of the
//              125MHz reference clock; at 10Mbps, this data will be
//              repeated for a hundred clock period duration of the
//              125MHz reference clock.
//
//              This module will sample the input transmitter GMII data
//              synchronously to the 125MHz reference clock.  This
//              sampled data can then be connected direcly to the input
//              GMII- style interface of the Ethernet 1000BASE-X PCS/PMA
//              or SGMII LogiCORE.
